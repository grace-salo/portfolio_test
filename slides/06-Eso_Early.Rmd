Early Stage cancers are those that are T1 or T2 and N0M0.  

If these are not familiar concepts please refer to videos which discuss staging.

---

In short, early stage cancers consist of small tumors without involvement of the lymph nodes, and they are either T1 or T2.

T1 tumors are treated very differently from T2 tumors, to it is important to distinguish between the two.

# Endoscopic Ultrasound

Endoscopic ultrasound is the best test to distinguish T1 tumors from T2 tumors.

From a patient's perspective it's very similar to an upper endoscopy.  Under sedation, the gastroenterologist places a scope through the mouth into the esophagus.  The difference is that at the end of the scope, there is located a tiny ultrasound probe, which can take pictures of the wall of the esophagus and measure the tumor in the esophagus.

---

The endoscopic ultrasound will give one of three answers:

T1 tumor -> can frequently be treated through the endoscope, without the need for surgery. We'll discuss that more 

T2 -> Are usually treated with surgery

T3 -> Treated with a combination of chemotherapy
