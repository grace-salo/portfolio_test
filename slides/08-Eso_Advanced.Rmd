# Introduction

I’m Dr Jonathan Salo,  a GI Cancer Surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina.

If you're viewing this video, chances are that you or someone close to you has encountered esophageal cancer and is contemplating treatment.

---

This video focuses on patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. This is defined as T3 or Node-positive esophageal cancer.  

If that terminology is unfamiliar or you haven't seen our video on Esophageal Cancer Treatment Options video, a link is provided in the description.


---

For a refresher, we have four major categories of esophageal cancers:

- Superficial -> Treated without surgery
- Localized -> Treated with surgery alone
- Locally Advanced -> Chemotherapy + Radiation -> Surgery
- Metastatic -> Chemotherapy

---

We're going to focus on two categories: localized and locally advanced
