# Introduction

I’m Dr Jonathan Salo,  a GI Cancer Surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina.

If you're viewing this video, chances are that you or someone close to you has encountered esophageal cancer and is contemplating treatment.

---

This video focuses on patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. This is defined as T3 or Node-positive esophageal cancer.  

If that terminology is unfamiliar or you haven't seen our video on Esophageal Cancer Treatment Options video, a link is provided in the description.


---

For a refresher, we have four major categories of esophageal cancers:

- Superficial -> Treated without surgery
- Localized -> Treated with surgery alone
- Locally Advanced -> Chemotherapy + Radiation -> Surgery
- Metastatic -> Chemotherapy

---

We're going to focus on two categories: Locally Advanced and Metastatic.

---

The key difference between locally advanced and metastatic tumors is whether there is spread to other organs such as the liver or lungs.

Locally advanced tumors are staged as M0, while metastatic tumors are staged as M1


---

# CT scan

Often the first test that is done for staging is a CT scan. The CT scan will show whether there is spread to the liver or lungs.

---

# PET scan

A PET scan is similar to at CT scan, but it also uses a tracer made from sugar which can light up areas of tumor.  From the patient perspective, this is similar to a CT scan.  Because the test uses a tracer made from labeled sugar, it is important that your blood sugar level not be too high.  For most patients, this means not eating for 4 hours before the exam and not drinking anything except water for the 4 hours before.

# Treatment

For patients with Locally Advanced tumors that are T3 and M0, the usual treatment is a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery called trimodality therapy.  There is a link here for a video that discussed the treatment of Locally Advanced tumors.

For patients with Metastatic tumors that are M1, the usual treatment is chemotherapy.  In most cases, this is given intravenously through a central venous port.  Chemotherapy is administered under the care of a Medical Oncologist. [Metastatic Esophageal Cancer](16-Eso_Metastatic.html)
