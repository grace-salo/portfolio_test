[Plan](00-Esophagus_Plan.pdf)

Metastatic esophageal cancer is cancer that has spread to other organs such as the liver, lungs, or bone.


The primary treatment for metastatic esophageal cancer is chemotherapy, which is usually given intravenously.

---

The first step wil be staging scans such as a CT scan or PET scan.  If you haven't done so already, please take a look at our video that talks about these scans [Advanced Esophageal Cancer](08-Eso_Advanced.html)

---

The next step will be meeting with a *Medical Oncologist* to develop a treatment plan.

---

If you have had difficulty eating or weight loss, you may need a feeding tube to help maintain your nutrition.  Please see our video on nutrition during esophageal cancer treatement [Nutrition in Esophageal Cancer](22-NutritionEsoCa.html)

---

Because most ot the chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously, you may need a central venous port [Central Venous Port](26-Port.html)
