# Introduction

Iâ€™m Dr Jonathan Salo,  a GI Cancer Surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In this video, you will learn about

- Different kinds of surgery for esophageal cancer
- Risks of surgery
- How you can reduce the risk of surgery

In another video, we'll talk about how to choose a hospital and surgeon for your esophagectomy.

---

Surgery for esophageal cancer is generally performed for three different situations:

- Superficial Tumors (T1) that can't be completely removed by endoscopy
- Localized Tumors (T2N0)
- Locally Advanced Tumors (T3 or N+) after the completion of chemotherapy and radiation

If you haven't seen it already, this may be a good time to view the Esophageal Cancer Treatment Options video.

# Goals of Esophagectomy

.pull-left[
- Remove tumor from esophagus
- Remove surrounding lymph nodes
- Create a new esophagus
]

# Resection

.pull-left[


The *Ivor Lewis* esophagectomy, shown here, removes the lower 2/3 of the esophagus, the tumor, and the surrounding lymph nodes from the chest.
]


.pull-right[

# Reconstruction

.pull-left[

A new esophagus is created from the stomach in the abdomen by fashioning it into a tube.
]


.pull-right[
<img src="images/Eso_Resection3Artboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%">
]

# Ivor Lewis esophagectomy

.pull-left[The new esophagus is now brought up into the chest. A new connection is made between the esophagus and the stomach, called an *anastomosis*.]

.pull-right[

# Open Esophagectomy

.pull-left[Open esophagectomy requires incisions in the abdomen and the right chest. ]

.pull-right[<img src="images/IvorLewisArtboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%">]

---


# Minimally-invasive Ivor Lewis

.pull-left[Mininally-invasive esophagectomy uses small incisions in the abdomen and chest.

The smaller incisions mean faster recovery and less discomfort]

.pull-right[<img src="images/MIE_IvorLewisArtboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%">]

# Minimally-invasive Ivor Lewis

.pull-left[We have found this is the best option for most of our patients]

.pull-right[<img src="images/MIE_IvorLewisArtboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%">]

---


# Total Esophagectomy

.pull-left[For patients with tumors in the upper esophagus, we need to remove more of the esophagus]

.pull-right[<img src="images/Eso_ProxTumorArtboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%">]

# Minimally-invasive McKeown Esophagectomy

.pull-left[In this case, a connection between the esophagus and the stomach is made in the neck.]

.pull-right[<img src="images/Eso_MIE_McKeownArtboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%">]

---

# Transhiatal Esophagectomy

.pull-left[Another option is a transhiatal esohagectomy, which avoids the need to make incisions in the right chest.]

When you meet with your surgeon, you will have an opportunity to meet with your surgeon to discuss your particular situation and their recommendation for surgery.

---

# Risks of Surgery

An esophagectomy is a substantial operation, and there can be postoperative complications. We're going to talk about two of these complications and how you can reduce your risk of complications:

- Anastomotic leak
- Pneumonia

---


# Anastomotic Leak

.pull-left[The anastomosis is surigcal connection between the esophagus and the stomach. ]

.pull-right[<img src="images/Eso_AnastArtboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%">]

---

# Anastomotic Leak

.pull-left[If anastomosis does not heal properly, this can cause a leakage of fluid from the esophagus, called an anastomotic leak.] 

.pull-right[<img src="images/Eso_LeakArtboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%">]

---

# Anastomotic Leak

 In some cases, the leak will heal on its own, but other cases may require additional procedures or even surgery. The risk of leak depends upon the operation performed but also depends upon the experience of the surgeon.  At the end of this video we have a link to a video about how to choose a hospital and a surgeon, which talks further about the risks of a leak.
 
---

# Pneumonia

.pull-left[Pneumonia is another complication which can occurs in about 10-15% of patients after esophagectomy. Pneumonia requires treatment with antibiotics and frequently requires a longer hospitalization.]

.pull_right[<img src="images/Eso_LungsArtboard 2@4x.png" width="50%" height = "50%">]

---

# Preventing Pneumonia

There are two important ways to help prevent pneumonia after surgery:

- Deep breathing
- Walking

---

# Deep breathing

After surgery, it's important to breathe deeply to help your lungs recover after surgery. An incentive spirometer is a device that helps you take deep breaths after surgery.  Your nurse will show you how to use it. There's a link in the description below to a video that shows how to use an incentive spirometer.


---

#  Walking

Walking after surgery is also an important way to help your lungs recover as well.  When we walk, it's easier for our lungs to function.

# Preventing Pneumonia

How can we prevent pneumonia? Believe it or not, I can tell who is more likely to develop pneumonia after surgery when I first meet them and shake their hand. Someone with a firm handshake has a lower risk of pneumonia.

# Strength

In our clinic, we actually measure your strength with a hand-held strength gauge called a dynamometer. Based upon these measurements, we can identify patients who may be at risk of pneumonia.


# Patient Health and Esophagectomy Outcomes

About half of our patients have good strength, shown in green.
A quarter are have low strength, shown in red
Another quarter are in the middle, shown in yellow

# Pneumonia

Overall, the risk of pneumonia is about 10% in our patients who undergo esophagectomy. 90% of patients never experience pneumonia, but 10% will have pneumonia after surgery.

However the risk of pneumonia is not the same for everyone.  Even though the average risk is 10%, the risk is much higher for our poor risk patients and much lower for our good risk patients.

For the half of our patients who are in good overall health, the risk of pneumonia is about 5%. On the other hand, the risk of pneumonia is 20% in the quarter of our patients who are in poor health.

# Muscle Strength and Risk after Esophagectomy

.pull-left[The results of our research suggest a simple answer: The risk of pneumonia is related to a patient's muscle strength.]

.pull-right[<img src="images/emancipation-156066_1280.png" width="100%" height = "100%">]

---

.pull-left[Now this doesn't mean that you need to look like this to prevent pneumonia after your esophagectomy]

.pull-right[<img src="images/man-461195_1920.jpg" width="100%" height = "100%">]

The good news is that you can increase your muscle strength before surgery in two very simple ways:

- Good nutrition with adequate intake of protein

- Exercise

---

In short, we want to make certain that our men are getting at least 75 grams of protein per day, and women at least 60 grams. 

If you haven't watched our video on Nutrition for Esophageal Cancer Treatment, there will be a link at the end of the video.

---

#  Exercise

When it comes to exercise, we ask our patients to engage in 30 minutes of vigorous exercise 6 days per week in preparation for surgery.  

We define *vigorous* exercise as working hard enough that it's hard to carry on a conversation while exercising.  You should still be able to breath easily, but working just hard enough that talking is difficult.

 It's important to start slow, especially if you haven't been used to exercising.

---

# Heart Rate

Another way to judge your heart rate is to use a heart rate monitor.  The following is an approximate range of heart rate during exerise:

Age | Minimum | Maximum
--------|---------|---------
40 | 125 | 150
50 | 120 | 145
60 | 112 | 135
70 | 105 | 127


---

# Exercise Options

.pull-left[If you have access to a gym, that would be an excellent option.  You'll be surrounded by other people who are exercising, and that can help you get started. ]

.pull-right[<img src="images/sports-1962574_1920.jpg" width="100%" height = "100%">]


---

#  Exercise Bike

.pull-left[A stationary exercise bike is a great option.  If allows you to exercise consistently despite the weather, and it's more convenient than going to the gym. ]

.pull-right[<img src="images/00o0o_fZ5KwSJXSH2z_0v20t2_1200x900.jpg" width="100%" height = "100%">]

#  Exercise Bike


 An exercise bike doesn't need to be expensive. Here are some examples of bikes offered on Craigslist.

---

 Keep in mind that a lot of people buy exercise equipment as part of a New Year's resolution, but then by February 1st they are collecting dust. Don't be afraid to ask friends, family, and neighbors if anyone has a bike you can borrow as part of your cancer treatment.
 
 
---

# Walking

.pull-left[Another option if you can't get access to a gym or exercise equipment is walking. Bear in mind that if you want to get the most benefit from walking, it will need to be a brisk. ]

.pull-right[<img src="images/nature-2587309_1920.jpg" width="100%" height = "100%">]

---

.pull-left[ If you choose to walk for exercise, it will be important to use a heart rate monitor to make sure you can push yourself to walk at a brisk pace. ]

.pull-right[<img src="images/heart-rate-monitoring-device-1903997_1280.jpg" width="100%" height = "100%">]

---

# Heart Disease

.pull-left[If you have heart disease, or high blood pressure, I have one simple message before starting to exercise. Please ask your doctor before starting to exercise. They can help you design an exercise program that will be safe for you.]

.pull-right[<img src="images/stop-1374937_1920.jpg" width="100%" height = "100%">]



---

# Good News

The good news is that with proper nutrition and exercise, you can increase your muscle strength, and we have good reason to believe this will reduce your risk of complications after esophagectomy.
