# Introduction

I’m Dr Jonathan Salo,  a GI Cancer Surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina.

If you or someone close to you has been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, this video is for you.

In this video, you will learn about

- Four different categories of esophageal cancer
- How the cancer stage helps make treatment decisions

---

These videos were designed to help my patients understand their cancer and its treatment. 

The internet is a great tool for learning, including learning about cancer.

But when you or a family member receives a new diagnosis of cancer, it's important that you receive information that is specifically tailored to your situation.

---

There are four different treatment categories of esophageal cancer

- I = Superficial -> Treated without surgery
- II = Localized -> Treated with surgery alone
- III = Locally Advanced -> Chemotherapy + Radiation -> Surgery
- IV = Metastatic -> Chemotherapy

# Deciding on Treatment

Several Factors go into making a decision about treatment for esophageal cancer:

- Cancer Stage
- Overall fitness of the patient
- Patient preferences

The first task once we have a new diagnosis of cancer is staging. Staging is the process of finding out the extent of the cancer and how far it might have spread.

In some cases, there may be more than one treatment that is appropriate for the cancer stage, but the different treatments may be more or less rigorous.  In these cases, the overall health of the patient will help find the best treatment.

In other cases, there may be more than one treatment option and

This video will cover all four treatment categories, which for many people allows them to get a broad overview, but for some it can be a bit overwhelming because there is a lot of information that *may not* apply to them.

Some of you will want more specific information that applies to your situation or that of a family member. I'll try to direct you to the right information.

# Category? Stage?

You'll notice I'm using the terms " Treatment Category I" rather than "Stage I". The reason is very simple.  The cancer staging system was originally designed for researchers to predict outcomes after cancer treatment. 

But for cancer patients and their families, what's important is what the best treatment is for their cancer.  Unfortunately, the cancer stages don't exactly line up with how that cancer is treated.

For instance, some Stage II patients are best treated with surgery while other Stage II patients are best treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.

The goal of these videos is to help patients understand *cancer treatment*.

Having said that, Stage 1 patients are *generally* treated with Treatment Category I, and the same with Stages 2, 3, and 4

# What if I don't know the stage?

If you haven't met with your treatment team to talk about the stage, I can give you some general direction to help get you started.

Patients who had difficulty swallowing usually have Category III or Category IV cancers. If you want more specific information esophageal cancer and there is difficulty swallowing or weight loss involved, Click on the link above, which will give you information about how we approach esophageal cancer when there is difficulty swallowing. These videos talk about Category III and Stage IV cancers of the esophagus, and about staging and treatment.

Patients without difficulty swallowing often have Stage I or Stage II cancers. These patients may have bleeding, or heartburn, or may have no symptoms.  If you want more specific information about Category I or Category II cancers, click on the link above. This video will give you information about Category I and Category II cancers, and about staging and treatment.

The first step in designing a treatment plan for esophageal cancer is staging. If you haven't seen it already, please see the video about esophageal cancer diagnosis and staging to give you an overview.

Once we have determined the Tumor, Nodes, and
Metastasis category, for a tumor, we can begin
to develop a treatment plan.
Here’s where things get a bit complicated
American Joint Commission on Cancer publishes
a book about the staging system for esophageal
cancer, and it’s a bit complex
--
The AJCC staging system is designed for research
and statistics, and it consists of 13 different
categories. As you might imagine, it’s too
complex for our purposes.
The purpose of these videos is for you to have
enough background that you can have an
informed decision with your esophageal cancer
care team.
We’ll talk about that team later in the video

---
For simplicity, we are going to talk about different
treatment categories of esophageal cancer, and
how they are generally treated. You and your
cancer care team will find the right treatment
that’s best for you

---

In general, we can talk about four different
categories of esophageal cancer:
Superficial cancers can frequently be treated with
endoscopy, without the need for surgery
Early stage cancers can be treated with surgery
and frequently don’t require chemotherapy or
radiation
Locally advanced cancers are usually treated with
chemotherapy and radiation first, then surgery
Metastatic cancers are usually treated with
chemotherapy
---

Superficial cancers are T1a and some T1b
cancers. These can frequently be removed from
inside the esophagus with an endoscope and
never need surgery.
Early stage cancers are T1b and some T2
cancers. These are usually treated with surgery
and don’t need chemotherapy and radiation
---
Locally advanced tumors are T3 or node-positive
tumors, meaning N1 or N2 or N3. These cancers
are treated with chemotherapy and radiation
first, which is then followed by surgery.

Metastatic cancers are M1, in which cancer has
spread to other organs. These cancers are
treated with chemotherapy.
---


To Summarize:
Superficial Cancers can be treated with an
endoscope without the need for surgery using
techniques such as endoscopic mucosal
resection. These tumors are generally T1aN0M0
---
This drawing represents a superficial tumor which
would be a candidate for endoscopic therapy:
The tumor is T1a, and just invades the top layer.
The lymph nodes are N0, which means there is
no signs of spread to the lymph nodes
---
This drawing shows an early-stage tumor which
would be a candidate for primary surgery:
Either T1b or T2, these tumors invade to far into
the wall of the esophagus to be treated with
endoscopic therapy. The lymph nodes are N0,
which means there is no signs of spread to the
lymph nodes
---

This shows a locally-advanced tumor which is
either T3 or has positive nodes, meaning N1 or
N2 or N3
These tumors are best treated by a combination of
chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgery
---

Esophageal cancer is considered metastatic if
there is signs of spread to other organs such as
the liver, lungs, or bone. These cancers are
considered M1 and are best treated with
chemotherapy.

#Care Team

The care of esophageal cancer takes a whole
team working together to give you the best care.
Let’s take a look at the different team members:
---
Gastroenterologist works with an endoscope,
which is a flexible tube which inserted through
the mouth into the esophagus. The
gastroenterologist may perform one of several
procedures in your care:

Upper endoscopy to examine the inside of the
esophagus and stomach and biopsy any
concerning areas

Endoscopic ultrasound is used in some cases to
carefully examine the depth of invasion of a
tumor in the esophagus or stomach

---


A gastroenterologist may also treat superficial
cancers of the esophagus and stomach with
endoscopic therapy such as an endoscopic
mucosal resection
---

Diagnostic radiologist
Interpret CT or PET scans
Perform biopsies under the guidance of CT or
ultrasound
---

Medical Oncologist
Treat cancer with chemotherapy or
immunotherapy, using drugs given intravenously
(and sometimes by pill).
---
Radiation Therapist
Treats cancer with high-energy x-rays that target
tumors in the esophagus and nearby lymph
nodes
---
# Surgeon
Perform surgery to remove the cancer in the
esophagus and surrounding lymph nodes and
reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract. This
usually means creating a new esophagus from a
portion of the stomach.
A surgeon would also place a feeding tube if
needed, and place a central venous port for
chemotherapy.
---
Treatment is based upon stage and the ability of a
patient to undergo treatment
In some cases, treatment decisions are
straightforward, while in others, decision-making
is more complex
Complex cases often require consultation with
other specialists
