# Introduction

Iâ€™m Dr Jonathan Salo,  a GI Cancer Surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In this video, you will learn about

- Different kinds of surgery for esophageal cancer
- Risks of surgery
- How you can reduce the risk of surgery

In another video, we'll talk about how to choose a hospital and surgeon for your esophagectomy.

---

Surgery for esophageal cancer is generally performed for three different situations:

- Superficial Tumors (T1) that can't be completely removed by endoscopy
- Localized Tumors (T2N0)
- Locally Advanced Tumors (T3 or N+) after the completion of chemotherapy and radiation

If you haven't seen it already, this may be a good time to view the Esophageal Cancer Treatment Options video.

# Goals of Esophagectomy

.pull-left[
- Remove tumor from esophagus
- Remove surrounding lymph nodes
- Create a new esophagus

# Resection

.pull-left[


The *Ivor Lewis* esophagectomy, shown here, removes the lower 2/3 of the esophagus, the tumor, and the surrounding lymph nodes from the chest.

# Reconstruction

.pull-left[

A new esophagus is created from the stomach in the abdomen by fashioning it into a tube.

# Ivor Lewis esophagectomy

.pull-left[The new esophagus is now brought up into the chest. A new connection is made between the esophagus and the stomach, called an *anastomosis*.]

# Minimally-invasive Ivor Lewis

.pull-left[Mininally-invasive esophagectomy uses small incisions in the abdomen and chest and avoids a neck incision.

We have found at our hospital to be best choice for most patients.

The smaller incisions mean faster recovery and less discomfort]

# Transhiatal Esophagectomy

.pull-left[For patients with small tumors or those with poor lung, an alternative is a transhiatal esohagectomy, which avoids the need to enter the right chest.]

When you meet with your surgeon, you will have an opportunity to meet with your surgeon to discuss your particular situation and their recommendation for surgery.

# Risks of Surgery

An esophagectomy is a substantial operation, and there can be postoperative complications. There are three major complications:

- Pneumonia
- Anastomotic leak
- Death

---

# Pneumonia

Pneumonia occurs in about 10-15% of patients after esophagectomy. Pneumonia requires treatment with antibiotics and frequently requires a longer hospitalization.

&lt;img src="images/Eso_LungsArtboard 2@4x.png" width="50%" height = "50%"&gt;

---

# Anastomotic Leak

.pull-left[The anastomosis is surigcal connection between the esophagus and the stomach. ]

.pull-right[&lt;img src="images/Eso_AnastArtboard 2@4x.png" width="100%" height = "100%"&gt;]

---

# Anastomotic Leak

.pull-left[If anastomosis does not heal properly, this can cause a leakage of fluid from the esophagus, called an anastomotic leak.  In some cases, the leak will heal on its own, but other cases may require additional procedures or even surgery. The rate of leak depends upon the surgeon and the type of operation, but can range from 2-15%]

.pull-right[&lt;img src="images/Eso_LeakArtboard 2@4x.png" width="50%" height = "50%"&gt;]

---

# Death

In come unusual cases, complications after surgery can result in death.  This is a very unusual event after surgery, but the risk of death after surgery needs to figure in to decision-making.  

---

# What are my chances?

In general, outcomes after surgery are better at hospitals that perform esophagectomy frequently, compared with hospitals where an esophagectomy is only done occasionally.  To get a ball-park idea of what the risks of complications are, the following are figures reported from a group of 24 high-volume hospitals for complications after esophagectomy:


- Pneumonia 15%
- Anastomotic leak 11%
- Death within 90 days of surgery 4.5%

---

These are overall numbers, and represent the risk for an average patient. As you might expect, the risks of surgery are greater for patients are in poor overall health, and better for patients in good overall health.


# Risks of Complications

The risk of complications in part on the patient's overall health. When I see patients in the office at our cancer center, we evaluate their overall fitness, and our experience allows us to calculate how this affects the risk of complications after esophagectomy.

---

# Patient Health and Esophagectomy Outcomes

When we evaluate patients for surgery, we group them into three groups:

Good risk group is about half the patients
Another quarter of patients is medium risk
Another quarter are high risk patients

# Risk of Death



![](12_Eso_Surgery_files/figure-html/mort_fig-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
---

&lt;small&gt;The risk of death after esophagectomy is about twice as high in hospitals which perform less than 5 esophagectomy operations per year.&lt;/small&gt;

# Understanding Outcomes

Let's talk Baseball for a minute.  Micky Mantle is regarded as one of baseball's greats, and this baseball card from 1952 is one of the most valuable in history.

If you look at the back of his card, you'll find lost of statistics, including his batting average. The numbers are there for anyone to see, including his batting average. If you're a baseball fan, one of the ways you evaluate players is based upon their statistics.

Unfortunately, there aren't baseball cards for hospitals and surgeons, and finding the statistics for a hospital or surgeon can be a challenge, but it's still important if you want the best chance for a good outcome after surgery.

---

# Hospital Volume

&lt;small&gt;Practice makes perfect in many things in life, and esophageal surgery is no exception.&lt;/small&gt;

Hospitals where an esophagectomy is performed more frequently in general have better outcomes than hospitals where the operation is only occasionally done. 

---

This chart shows the relationship between hospital volume and the risk of death after esophagectomy.


---

# Finding a Hospital

The easiest way to find out whether a particular hospital is high volume or low volume is to ask your surgeon. 

Another method is to do some research on the internet. The Leapfrog Group is a non-profit organization that collects and published safety in healthcare. Their website ranks hospitals for safety and can help you find a high-volume hospital.  A link to their website is available here: [HospitalSafetyGrade.org](https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org)

---

# Leapfrog Group Website

You can search on a hospital. Once there, click "View this hospital's leapfrog Hospital Survey Results"

Of course there are low-volume hospital that have good outcomes, but starting with a high-volume hospital is a place to start.

The Leapfrog Group 

# Choosing a Surgeon

The surgeon is another key factor in the outcome of an operation.  The Leapfrog recommends a minimum of seven operations per year for surgeons undertaking esophagectomy.

The surgeon's track record of outcomes is also an extremely helpful way to predict outcomes.  Finding out this information may require some uncomfortable questions, but this is important information.  It is critical to know both what the track record of the hospital is, but also the track record of a particular surgeon.

---

# Your Surgeon's Outcomes

Knowing your surgeon's outcomes is important, but knowing your surgeon's outcomes is probably more important.  Your surgeon should be able to tell you what their statistics are for outcomes like anastomotic leak, pneumonia, and death after surgery.

If you surgeon doesn't know their personal statistics, you may want to look for a second opinion.  After all, if you met a professional baseball player, you would expect that they would be familiar with their batting average. 

---

# Questions for Your Surgeon

1) How many esophagectomy operations are performed each year in your hospital?
2) How many esophagectomy operations do you perform personally each year?
3) What are your overall rates of complications?
  - Pneumonia
  - Anastomotic Leak
  - Death in the first 90 days after surgery

# High risk vs low risk


Auto safety has improved over the years, and fatal auto accidents are quite rate.  
Average driver has a risk of fatal auto accident of 2.1 per 100 million miles driven

![](12_Eso_Surgery_files/figure-html/fatalauto_fig2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
---

But we know from our own experience that some drivers are at at higher risk than others.

For instance, what about these two drivers?

.pull-left[&lt;img src="images/driving-407181_1920.jpg" width="100%" height = "100%"&gt;]
.pull-right[&lt;img src="images/woman-289315_1920.jpg" width="100%" height = "100%"&gt;]

---

Even if you didn't know these two individuals, you would guess that a man in his 20s has a higher risk of a fatal auto acccident than a women in her 30s.

Statistically, this is true.



---


While the overall rate is 2.1 deaths, the rate for men in their 20s is six times higher than women in their 30s

![](12_Eso_Surgery_files/figure-html/fatalauto2_fig-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

Now the auto insurance companies have noticed that young men are in a high risk group, and women are in a good risk group.  Anyone who has had to pay for auto insurance for a young man understands this.
